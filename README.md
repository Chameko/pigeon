# Pigeon

A simple, crossplatform 2D rendering library.

## Why

Pigeon's development is primarily driven by the need for a graphical backend for AVN. However I also wanted to keep it seperate from AVN so it could be used for other projects, such as a backend for [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui).

## Disclaimer

I am very new to graphics programming and this is more or less an effort to increase my understanding. Use at your own risk

## Dependencies

Pigeon uses parrot as a middleware layer between it and wgpu and uses winit for windowing.
